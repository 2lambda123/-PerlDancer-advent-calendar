=head1 Map the Way with Dancer::Plugin::SiteMap

I was sitting staring at yet another XML site map document when it came
to me; It should be easier than this!

Enter 
L<Dancer::Plugin::SiteMap|http://search.cpan.org/~jamesr/Dancer-Plugin-SiteMap-0.05/lib/Dancer/Plugin/SiteMap.pm> 
- The easy way to map.

=head2 So How Does It Work?

Simplicity itself:

    use Dancer;
    use Dancer::Plugin::SiteMap;

That's it! Your Dancer App now has C</sitemap> and C</sitemap.xml>
routes.

=head2 What's In Store For The Future?

Eventually I'd like to add support for optional custom template of
the HTML SiteMap.
