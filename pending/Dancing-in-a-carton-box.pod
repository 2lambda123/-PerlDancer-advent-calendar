=head1 Dancing in a Carton

My new favorite way to package L<Dancer2> applications nowadays is L<Carton>.
You setup a single file, type a command or two, and you're done. Here's how
it works and how you set it up yourself.

=head2 What Carton does?

L<Carton> sets up a local copy of your project prerequisites. You only need
to define them in a file and ask Carton to download all of them and set them
up.

When you want to deploy your app, you just carry the git clone and ask
Carton to set up the environment again and you will then be able to run it.

The benefit is multi-fold:

=over 4

=item * Local directory copy

By putting all the dependencies in a local directory, you can make sure
they aren't updated by someone else by accident and their versions locked
to the version you picked.

=item * Sync versions

Deciding which versions of the dependent modules your project needs allows
you to sync this across other developers as well. Suddenly you're all using
the same version. Those versions don't change unless you want them to, and
then everyone, again, uses the same new versions.

=item * Carry only the requirement, not bundled modules

Instead of bundling the modules, you only actually bundle the definitions.
Carton builds them for you when you need it.

=head2 Setting it up

First thing we do is set up a new app:

    $ dancer2 -a MyApp
    ...

Then we delete the files we don't care about:

    $ rm -f Makefile.PL MANIFEST MANIFEST.SKIP

Now let's create a Git repo:

    $ git init && git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"

Let's add a definition using the L<cpanfile> format:

    $ cat > cpanfile
    requires 'Dancer2' => 0.155000;
    requires 'Template' => 0;
    recommends 'URL::Encode::XS' => 0;
    recommends 'CGI::Deurl::XS' => 0;
    recommends 'HTTP::Parser::XS' => 0;

We can now ask Carton to set it up:

    $ carton install
    Installing modules using [...]
    Successfully installed [...]
    ...
    Complete! Modules were install into [...]/local

Now we have two files: F<cpanfile> and F<cpanfile.snapshot>. We add both of
them to our Git repository and we make sure we don't accidentally add the
F<local/> directory Carton created which holds the modules it installed:

    $ echo local/ >> .gitignore
    $ git add .gitignore cpanfile cpanfile.snapshot
    $ git commit -m "Start using carton"

When we want to update the versions on the production machine, we simply
call:

    $ carton install --deployment

By using C<--deployment> we make sure we only install the modules we have in
our F<cpanfile.snapshot> file and does not fallback to querying the CPAN.

=head2 Conclusion

Setting up L<Carton> takes two minutes and allows us to provide specific
requirements for our applications and a mechanism to install them on a
production machine while ensuring it will create a local copy of everything.

We no longer care about the system module versions and we can maintain
multiple versions of each module used in each separate application. If a
certain application doesn't need to update a module, it just doesn't, while
not preventing another application from update its own version of the module.

Try it out, you'll love it!
