Dancer advent calendar 2011

Article suggestions / volunteers to write them very much appreciated.

This README will be updated with each suggestion and the flags listed below used
to indicate the status of that article.

When we decide what order to run them in, we'll then reshuffle them into order.

If you have ideas or want to volunteer, find us in irc.perl.org/#dancer, or
email the dancer-users mailing list, or contact davidp@preshweb.co.uk - thanks!


Flags: 

[ ] : up for adoption
[A] : "Assigned", someone volunteered to write it
[P] : "Pending", someone started writing that article
[R] : "Review", ready for review (needs typos fixes and proofreading)
[D] : "Done", ready for publication
[L] : "Last Review", reviewed but still some things left undone

==== ARTICLE IDEAS:

[ ] - What a difference a year makes
      progress since last year - reading through CHANGES and writing about all
      the new features (if this becomes a bit long, it could be split over
      multiple days)

[ ] - Dancer2 progress, design choices etc - I think we can expand this one out
      into multiple posts about the upcoing Dancer2's design etc.

[ ] - State of the ecosystem
      a writeup of various Dancer plugins, especially ones which are new since
      last year; this could be a series of posts over multiple days

[ ] - Thanking contributors
      We could do a post thanking all the people who've contributed over the
      last year, with a short description of each thing they contributed

[ ] - Dancing on the big screen
      Summarise talks mentioning Dancer at various Perl events

[ ] - Dancer workshop at LPW2011
      I think it would be nice to speak to Andrew Solomon who did a Dancer
      training session at LPW2011 and get some feedback on how the session went,
      how many attended, the general reaction of the attendees etc.  We could
      perhaps also contact some of the attendees and ask for feedback on what
      they thought of Dancer and the workshop.

[A] - Profiling Dancer apps - bigpresh
      A quick writeup of using Dancer::Plugin::NYTProf to profile apps.

[A] - D::P::SimpleCRUD - bigpresh
      a writeup of D::P::SimpleCRUD, describing the features it offers, probably
      with some screenshots of it in action etc.

[A] - Writing Unicode-safe Dancer apps (Penfold)
      Correct Unicode usage in Dancer apps, from an expert :)
