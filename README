Dancer advent calendar 2016

Article suggestions / volunteers to write them very much appreciated.

This README will be updated with each suggestion and the flags listed below used
to indicate the status of that article.

When we decide what order to run them in, we'll then reshuffle them into order.

If you have ideas or want to volunteer, find us in irc.perl.org/#dancer, or
email the dancer-users mailing list, or contact xsawyerx@cpan.org - thanks!

Flags: 

[ ] : up for adoption
[A] : "Assigned", someone volunteered to write it
[P] : "Pending", someone started writing that article

==== ARTICLE IDEAS:

[ ] - Changes since last year: fixes, features, etc.

[ ] - State of the ecosystem
      a writeup of various Dancer plugins, especially ones which are new since
      last year; this could be a series of posts over multiple days

[ ] - New parameters keywords and why params() is bad.

[ ] - Asynchronousity in Dancer2.

[ ] - How to speed up Dancer2.
      (This would be based on the lightning talk at DancerConf-2016.)

[ ] - Searching with multiple fields and pagination.
