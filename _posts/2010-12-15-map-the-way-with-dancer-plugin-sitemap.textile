<h2>Map the Way with Dancer::Plugin::SiteMap</h2>

<p>I was sitting staring at yet another XML site map document when it came to me; It should be easier than this!</p>

<p>Enter Dancer::Plugin::SiteMap - The easy way to map.</p>

<h3>So How Does It Work?</h3>

<p>Simplicity itself:</p>

<pre><code>    use Dancer;
    use Dancer::Plugin::SiteMap;</code></pre>

<p>That's it! Your Dancer App now has <code>/sitemap</code> and <code>/sitemap.xml</code> routes.</p>

<h3>What's In Store For The Future?</h3>

<p>Eventually I'd like to add support for optional custom template of the HTML SiteMap.</p>
