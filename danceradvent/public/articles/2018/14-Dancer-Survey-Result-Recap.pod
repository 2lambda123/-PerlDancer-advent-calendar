=head2 Common reasons for not recommending

=head2 Areas of improvement/things to improve

* This stood out to me:
    
"More tutorials. Especially about deployment. I believe the greatest hurdle for new developers (as in new new, who start doing web stuff in Perl, or programming in general, with Dancer) is not to get started, but to get done. There is a lot of good content in all the major frameworks in the Perl ecosystem on how to build an application, but all of them lack in-depth tutorials with different alternatives for how to deploy them. This includes telling inexperienced users what hosting a web application means, what the different deployment types with PSGI do and which one to pick. I think having a really good guide would set Dancer apart from other frameworks."

=head2 Cool uses of Dancer

* Service monitoring dashboard
* VOIP provisioning app
* Benefits management software
* thegamecrafter.com component.studio tabletop.events wingapi.com
* Unattended installation portal

=head2 Feedback from survey that has been addressed

* Lack of web sockets - see Yanick’s plugin
* Documentation - number of patches since, with a manual rewrite in the works
