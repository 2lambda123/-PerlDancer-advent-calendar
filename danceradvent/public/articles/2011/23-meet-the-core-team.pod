=head1 Meet the core team

Dancer has evolved quickly to a port prototype to a fully featured
micro-framework. This has been possible thanks to a vast community of users who
contributed ideas, bug reports and patches.

Time after time, some of these users appeared to be very motivated and
productive and it's quite naturally that a I<Core Team> emerged.

In this article we'll present each member of the team in order to let you know
put some faces behind the Git history. 

The core team is probably the best feature of Dancer, so please, let me
introduce you the men that make Perl dance!
