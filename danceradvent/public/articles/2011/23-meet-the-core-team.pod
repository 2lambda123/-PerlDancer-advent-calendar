=head1 Meet the core team

Dancer has evolved quickly from a port prototype to a fully featured
micro-framework. This has been possible thanks to a vast community of users who
contributed ideas, bug reports and patches.

Time after time, some of these users appeared to be very motivated and
productive and it's quite naturally that a I<Core Team> emerged.

In this article we'll present each member of the team, so you could put some
faces behind the Git history and the IRC users.

The core team is probably the best feature of Dancer, so please, let me
introduce you the men who make Perl dance!

=head2 Sawyer X (sawyer)

First commit on Jan 13th, 2010 (<code>b7cc27b</code>)

Sawyer X has been using Perl for almost 10 years now. Organizer of TelAviv.pm
meetings, doubles as a Perl developer and systems administrator. Picked up
Dancer after checking out several small web frameworks on CPAN. The
responsiveness and kindness in the community opted him to suggest and develop
his first contribution to Dancer - a route caching system. Since then he has
become a core developer, project mentor and lecturer world-wide.

He is currently the maintainer and release manager of the 1.x branch.

David Precious (bigpresh) is a professional Perl developer from London,

He discovered Dancer in February 2010 whilst looking for a framework

squash, and enjoys drinking beer.

Damien is using Perl since 1999. Went on using Dancer
in late 2010 for a small project, done in 2 days. Amazed by the ease
of use, he started contributing, and got the commit bit soon after. He
has worked at Mandrakesoft, Mandriva, IDM, Venda, and now Weborama. He
organises the tech meeting of the Paris Perl Mongers since september
2011.

First commit Jul 17th 2009 (<code>da6c198</code>)

Alexis has been working in the Internet industry for more than ten
years now. He's always been passionated about computer programming and
free software. Perl has always been the language Alexis enjoys the most, and
luckily he always managed to find a paid-job with Perl throughout his carreer.

Before creating Dancer, Alexis used to be a Debian developer and wrote a
popular backup tool called Backup Manager.

In summer 2009 he started experimenting a port of the Ruby project I<Sinatra> in
Perl, that's how Perl Dancer was born.

Today, Alexis manages the R&D team at Weborama, a company that works in the
Internet advertisement industry.
